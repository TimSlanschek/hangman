We added a slight change from the norm for sending the final "You win!" or "You lose!" message.
The server sends the final game control packet, then the client checks if it is the final packet.
If so, it sends a packet to the server with 2 in the field of the first byte (rather than 0 or 1).
This tells the server to send a message packet with the "You {whatever}!" phrase.
