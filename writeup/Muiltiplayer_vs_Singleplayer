We included the files for both singleplayer and multiplayer modes

Singleplayer is the base version of the game without any extra credit

Multiplayer includes the extra credit on top of the single player mode.
Technically all singleplayer functionality should work just as well in singleplayer as multiplayer,
but if you get errors in singleplayer mode with the multiplayer file,
we recommend you test the functionality on the singleplayer mode, as it was more thoroughly tested.

To run single player mode, use the base `make run-server` or `make run-client`
To run multiplayer mode, use `make run-server-multi` or `make run-client-multi`

Multiplayer functionality is pretty straightforward, add a charactered when it is your turn.
